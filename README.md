# Sobel Edge Detection Accelerator

## Overview

This project implements a hardware-accelerated Sobel edge detection IP using Vitis HLS and deploys it through a PYNQ-based FPGA workflow. The accelerator receives grayscale image pixels through an AXI4-Stream input, computes Sobel edge magnitude using a streaming 3×3 convolution window, applies a programmable threshold, and outputs a binary edge map through AXI4-Stream.

The design goal is to build a lightweight image-processing accelerator with a clean streaming interface, deterministic throughput, and hardware/software validation evidence.

## IP Interface Definition

### Top-Level Function

```
void sobel_accel(
    hls::stream<pixel_data>& in_stream,
    hls::stream<pixel_data>& out_stream,
    int width,
    int height,
    int threshold
);
```

### Interfaces

| Port         | Interface   | Direction | Description                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `in_stream`  | AXI4-Stream | Input     | Input grayscale pixel stream  |
| `out_stream` | AXI4-Stream | Output    | Output binary edge map stream |
| `width`      | AXI4-Lite   | Input     | Runtime image width           |
| `height`     | AXI4-Lite   | Input     | Runtime image height          |
| `threshold`  | AXI4-Lite   | Input     | Sobel magnitude threshold     |
| `return`     | AXI4-Lite   | Control   | IP control/status register    |

The pixel stream uses an 8-bit AXI stream payload with side-channel signals:

```
typedef ap_axiu<8, 1, 1, 1> pixel_data;
```

This format is compatible with DMA-based image transfer and includes standard stream metadata such as `keep`, `strb`, `user`, and `last`.

## Accelerator Architecture

The accelerator is designed as a streaming image-processing pipeline.

### Dataflow

```
AXI4-Stream Input
        ↓
Pixel Read
        ↓
3-Line Buffer
        ↓
3×3 Sliding Window
        ↓
Sobel Gx / Gy Computation
        ↓
|Gx| + |Gy| Magnitude Approximation
        ↓
Thresholding
        ↓
AXI4-Stream Output
```

### Sobel Computation

For each valid 3×3 window, the accelerator computes horizontal and vertical gradients:

```
Gx = right column - left column
Gy = bottom row - top row
```

The edge magnitude is approximated as:

```
|Gx| + |Gy|
```

Then the output pixel is binarized:

```
output = 255 if magnitude > threshold
output = 0 otherwise
```

Boundary pixels are padded with black output.

## HLS Optimization Strategy

The design uses local buffering and pipelining to avoid full-frame storage.

### Optimization Techniques

- `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` on the main pixel-processing loop
- Complete partitioning of the 3-row line buffer dimension
- Complete partitioning of the 3×3 window
- Static buffer allocation with `MAX_WIDTH = 1920` and `MAX_HEIGHT = 1080`
- AXI4-Stream side-channel assignment for DMA compatibility
- TLAST generation on the final output pixel

The intended throughput is one output pixel per clock cycle after pipeline fill.

------

## Verification Methodology

### C Simulation

The C testbench verifies the accelerator using a 64×64 grayscale input image and a threshold value of 100.

Verification flow:

1. Load input pixels from `tb_input_pixels.txt`
2. Push pixels into the AXI4-Stream input
3. Run the HLS Sobel accelerator
4. Read the output stream
5. Compare every output pixel against the golden edge map in `tb_output_edge.txt`
6. Report pass/fail based on bit-true comparison

Expected successful output:

```
Running Sobel Accelerator...
TEST PASSED! 100% Bit-true match with Golden Model.
```

------

## Hardware Validation on PYNQ

The generated hardware bitstream was loaded and executed from a Jupyter notebook using DMA-based input/output transfer.

Observed hardware execution log:

```
Loading hardware bitstream...

Hardware loaded!
Configuring IP...
Initial IP Status: 0x4
Starting receive DMA...
Starting IP core...
Starting send DMA...
Success! Hardware finished in 2.96 ms
Final IP Status: 0xe
```

The hardware output produces a binary edge image from the input grayscale image, confirming that the accelerator completed successfully and returned a valid edge-detection result.

Export the synthesized Sobel accelerator as an IP block and integrate it with:

- AXI DMA
- AXI interconnect
